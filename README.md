# Sales Forecasting Project for a Coffee Store

This repository hosts an extensive project aimed at forecasting the sales of a coffee store, leveraging a multi-model approach that encompasses ARIMA time series analysis, Linear Regression Models (LLMs), and thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA). The project is structured in sprints, each focusing on different aspects of the forecasting challenge, from data preparation and analysis to model selection and validation.

## Overview of Project Structure

### Sprint 1: Initial Data Exploration and Analysis

- *Group_8_Sprint1.ipynb*: Introduces the project and begins the exploratory data analysis (EDA) process. This sprint focuses on understanding the dataset's characteristics, including sales trends, seasonality, and other patterns critical for model selection.

### Sprint 2: Advanced Data Analysis and Model Exploration

- *Group_8_sprint_2.ipynb and Sprint2_AI_EDA_Dataset2.ipynb*: Dive deeper into data analysis, exploring more complex relationships within the data. These notebooks likely include preliminary model testing, including linear regression models to assess linear trends and relationships.

### Sprint 3: Model Selection and Forecasting

- *Sprint3_AI_ABC_Analysis.ipynb*: Focuses on categorizing products using ABC analysis to prioritize forecasting efforts. This sprint may also introduce ARIMA modeling as a core forecasting technique, chosen for its efficacy in handling time series data with autocorrelation and seasonality.

- *Sprint_2_Classification.ipynb*: Although named as a second sprint, this notebook might explore classification models to segment the data further or to classify sales patterns, aiding in the ARIMA model's accuracy.

### Core Forecasting Model

- *Arima.ipynb*: The centerpiece of the forecasting effort, detailing the development, training, and validation of the ARIMA model. This notebook explains the selection of ARIMA parameters (p, d, q) based on the dataset's characteristics, aiming to predict future sales with high accuracy.

### Integrating External Factors

- *weather.csv*: Incorporates weather data as an external factor, analyzing its impact on sales to refine the forecasting model. This innovative approach acknowledges the influence of external conditions on sales trends.

### Web Application for Forecasting

- *Arima_webApp*: Suggests the development of a web application, potentially designed to showcase the forecasting model's predictions. This application would allow users to interact with the data and predictions, making the insights accessible to a broader audience.

### Documentation and Reporting

- *Final_report.docx*: Provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including methodologies, findings, and conclusions. This document serves as a formal report detailing every step of the project from conception to final predictions.

## Project Rationale

The multi-sprint approach allows for meticulous analysis and iterative improvement of the forecasting model. By combining ARIMA with LLMs and considering external factors like weather, the project aims to create a robust model that can accurately predict sales fluctuations, catering to both seasonal variations and linear trends.

## Conclusion

This detailed forecasting project exemplifies a sophisticated analytical approach to understanding and predicting sales trends. By leveraging multiple models and incorporating external data, it provides actionable insights for inventory management and strategic planning in a coffee store context.
